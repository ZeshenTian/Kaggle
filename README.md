# Kaggle

This repository provides all the Kaggle code written by me(if it's public...), including both the versions on Kaggle and the original versions. In the original versions, I will provide more details and a Chinese version(if I wrote it in Chinese orginally...). 

Warm welcome to contact me at zeshentian1@gmail.com!


2024.06 A [work](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zeshentian1/r2-0-94-nusvr-best-data-cleaning/edit/run/182168303) has been finished, with the topic of regreesion model for mobile phone price prediction.

## I'm looking for collaborators to explore Kaggle competitions with me(remote is fine). I particularly enjoy working in the fields of LLM, Graph, and Recommendation, but I'm also open to other fields. I Since I'm currently in Hefei, China and my hometown is Hangzhou, China, I especially welcome companions from USTC HFUT ZJU HDU!**

## 我正在寻找参加kaggle比赛的合作者，我个人特别喜欢LLM、Graph、Recommendation方向，其它方向也可以接受。因为我目前在安徽合肥，我家是杭州的，所以特别欢迎中科大、合工大、浙大、杭电的同学！（这样我们就可以线下面基了，手动滑稽）
